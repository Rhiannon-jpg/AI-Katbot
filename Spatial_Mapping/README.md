# Spatial Mapping
This folder contains the code and data for the MakerSpace spatial mapping model.

## Purpose
The model will allow the robotic cat to navigate around the MakerSpace.

## Roadmap
Set up and calibrate the Raspberry Pi camera

Find an open-source VSLAM library compatible with the Pi camera and integrate it with the robotic cat

Test model in the MakerSpace

After testing, add a neural network to improve model accuracy
