# LLM Q&A
This folder contains the code and data for fine-tuning the MakerSpace Q&A large language model.

## Purpose
Students often stop by the MakerSpace for tours and general information. The MakerSpace Q&A LLM will allow our robotic cat to answer a variety of questions, mapping different phrasings of the same question to one correct answer.

## Roadmap
Build a small-scale neural network from scratch as an MVP. 

Use Hugging Face and PEFT to fine tune an open-source LLM. 

Deploy the model via an API for integration with robotic cat.
