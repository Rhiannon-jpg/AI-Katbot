# Tool Recognition
This folder contains the code and data for the computer vision model.

## Purpose
The model will allow the robotic cat to assist MakerSpace users and staff in finding misplaced tools.

## Roadmap
Collect and preprocess publicly available images of tools commonly found in the MakerSpace.

Build a train a neural network to classiify tools

Integrate the model with the robotic cat's camera for real-time recognition.
